![ALX AFRICA AirBnB Clone](https://github.com/melissacinta/AirBnB_clone/assets/18717315/736a7848-c244-493d-9125-017a23762337)


## Project Description

The AirBnB clone project starts from 5th december 2023 until. the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

We won't implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, we will have a complete web application composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### Final Product
By the end of the 4 months, the final product should look like this

## General concepts in review

As you navigate this code base, it is great to note the following concepts, while completing this project.

- How to create a Python package
- How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- How to manage `datetime`
- What is an `UUID`
- What is `*args` and how to use it
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

## Phase One
This is the first step towards building our first full web application which is the AirBnB clone.
Each task in this phase is linked and will help to:

- put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`â€¦) that inherit from `BaseModel`
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


## Description of the command interpreter
| Commands  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```quit```  | Quits the console  |
| ```Ctrl+D```  | Quits the console  |
| ```help``` or ```help <command>```  | Displays all commands or Displays instructions for a specific command
